Aditya Dwivedi-
I worked further on the results page making it so that the history of previous test scores is saved and displayed on the final result page after giving multiple quizes. I made a JSON file with an empty array in it and mapped the quizical.ejs file to it to store all the quiz results in the json file. This helped store past quiz results and helped me display the quiz results on the result page. This involved writing reading and writing statement to map to the json file and also working closely with Tim as his and my code were connected by a lot.
