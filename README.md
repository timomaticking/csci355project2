Quiz Zone Project

Overview

Quiz Zone is a responsive and visually appealing web-based application designed for users to take quizzes across various themes such as Science, Education, Technology, and Computer Science. It includes pages for user login, registration, and password reset. The project adheres to a clean design with strict separation of HTML and CSS.

File Structure

The project consists of three HTML files (index.html, form.html, and reset.html) that serve as the homepage, signup page, and password reset page, respectively. These files are styled using three separate CSS files (style.css, form.css, and reset.css), ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design. The structure promotes modularity, with each page styled according to its specific requirements while maintaining a unified aesthetic across the application.
